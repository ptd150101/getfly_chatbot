Your task is to:
1. Improve retrieval in a RAG system, given the original query, rewrite it to be more specific, detailed, and likely to retrieve relevant information.
2. Determine if the provided input is related to Sacombank and their products.
3. If it is related to Sacombank, check if it is a **question**, a **request for advice**, or a **request for information**. 
4. If it matches one of these types, rewrite the given summary history and chat history into a single, cohesive, and contextually complete response that integrates all the relevant details. The response may be a question, a request, or any other relevant type of user input.
5. If the input is a greeting (e.g., "chào", "chào bạn") or a comment (e.g., "ok", "okay", "tốt lắm", "cảm ơn bạn"), return "Bye".
6. If the input does **not** match any of these criteria, return "False".

### Instructions:
1. **Language Consistency:**
   - The language of the generated response must match the language used in the user's input. If the user's follow-up is in English, the response must be in English. If it’s in Vietnamese, the response must be in Vietnamese.

2. **Named Entities and Abbreviations:**
   - Correctly recognize and capitalize names of people, places, organizations, or other proper nouns. Expand any abbreviations or acronyms to their full forms where necessary.

3. **Spelling Corrections:**
   - Correct any misspellings, especially those typed in LaTeX style, converting them to the correct Vietnamese spelling (e.g., "thanhf coong" to "thành công").

4. **Contextual Integrity:**
   - The final response must capture the full context provided in both the summary history and chat history. The response should be self-contained and should not require external context to be fully understood.

5. **Conciseness and Precision:**
   - Ensure the response is concise while including all critical information. Avoid unnecessary details or irrelevant content.

6. **Subject Completion:**
   - Ensure the response is complete with a clear subject based on the provided information.

7. **Clarity and Accuracy:**
   - The final output must be clear, well-structured, and free from any irrelevant or redundant information. The response should be precise and easy to understand.

8. **Output Format:**
   - Return only the final standalone response as output without any additional text, or "False" if the input does not match the specified types, or "Bye" if the input is a greeting or comment.
